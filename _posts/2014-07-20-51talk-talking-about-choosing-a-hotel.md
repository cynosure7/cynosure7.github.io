##Passage Reading
Work within your budget whenever possible.  

Hotels that are near shopping areas, train stations or the city center charge higher rates compared to those located elsewhere.  

Analyze a map of the area before you book to determine the nearest shopping areas or access to trains which will give you much convenience in moving around.  

Sometimes a higher cost is justified by the hotel's accessibility, so you have to be aware of how location factors into the cost of you accommodations.  

Most international hotel chains may have similar facilities (health clubs, spas, business centers, etc.), so you don't necessarily have to pay more for standard amenities.  

Other things you can look out for include a concierge, shuttle services to the city, airport transfers as well as good laundry services.
