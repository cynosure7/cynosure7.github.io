#Passage Reading
How does one make a sincere apology?  
1. Take responsibility for your actions
2. Ask for forgiveness OR **offer redress**
3. Shut up and let it end  

People want to **see you own up to your mitakes**.  
It's crucial moment because it set the tone and creates the momentum for your entire sincere apology.  
As an expression of repentance, of true regret or remote, this step matters more than all the rest when make a sincere apology.  
You can best archieve this repentance by using a simple, straightforward sentence that uses two magic words-I'm sorry.  
After you **uttered those humbling words**, address what you did in **concise **terms.  
When you make a sincere apology, it isn't the time to impose some ,oral duty; it's the time to throw out that hope of forgiveness withou implying any demands.  
This last step, however, may be the most difficult because the impetus to throw a variety of tags onto our apologies is sometimes over whelming. Continuing to talk only water down everything that's already been said. More often than not, we see this moment as an opportunity to squeeze in the last word and save face by somehow mitigating our mistakes. In doing so, you're bound to torpedo the whole apology. Shut up, don't say another word, and allow the matter end then and there.
