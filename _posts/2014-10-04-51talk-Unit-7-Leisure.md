Well, there's lot of different leisure activities I do in sapre time. At weekend, I hang out with my girlfriend and dine out. If there are attrative movies, we will go to moves. After work, I like to ride to swimming pool to enjoy swimming. I suppose swimming is a healthy activity that can be enjoyed by everyone. It's an excellent and relaxing way to exercise as the water supports the body, so less stress is placed on joints and bones. The swimming pool is not far away, it' s about ten minutes' ride from here. So I usually go there by bike, biking can save me money and at the same time, it warm me up. You know Warming up is very important, especially for swimming. You may get a cramp if you don't do that. If I fell tired, I may enjoy a sleep or just listen some relaxed music.
