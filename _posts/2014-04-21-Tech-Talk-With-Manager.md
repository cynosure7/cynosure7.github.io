##Background
Last week, two colleagues in team took PTO, so I took over some works which is emergency and vital. It's an opportunity as well as challenge. I accomplished it, well; there are a lot to improve.
In this morning, manager asked if I have time to talk. Obviously, he wanted to talk to me, about the work.
##Process
We come to a meeting room, and sit down. 
He said, "Do you have any ideas, think, opinion, bewilderment in your work". Oh, my! I'm almost speechless.
I came to this talk without any prepared, and this talk began with such a serious motif. I had no idea what should I say, and how to say.

Fortunately, he is experienced manager and he realized it. He downshift this talk into a small talk, he asked something about my life, including my girlfriend, hometown and so on.

Yes, this worked. I felt relaxed and started a conversation about work.
Firstly, I talked about my think about the work I took last week. I think the issue I fixed is both an opportunity and challenge for me. Also, I have two points to improve, the first one is my knowledge about our production is not enough, and the second one is I hope to take more tasks and responsibility.

He applauded my think, and he said he had some comments.
Yes, I think here will come the key point of this talk.
He said I need to make a conclusion of the task I take, and he showed the mails about the fixed issue. I saw it, in the mail, I was asked for some questions, but I ignored them. Yes, I missed it. I finished my work, but not update this to others nor answer others' questions. Which make me, the task owner, did not give a conclusion of my task. It's a serious miss, I think.

Then, he went through a PPT with me, the PPT was a training material about how to been a good employee.
It benefits me a lot. My only complaint in my heart was that I should know it earlier.

In post [Some Ideas for Graduate](http://helloowen.com/Work-Some-Ideas-for-Graduate/), I take some notes about it.

Thanks for this talk, thank my manger.
