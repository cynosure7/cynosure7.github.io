#Passage Reading
As much as possible, plan to stay in larger hotels that have more elaborated security. Safety experts recommend booking a room from the second to seventh floors above the ground level-high enough to deter easy entry from outside, but low enough for fire equipment to reach.  
When there is a choice of airport or airline, ask your travel agent about comparative safety records.  

Carry a minimum number of valuables, and plan places to conceal them.

Avoid handbags, fanny packs and outside pockets that are easy targets for thieves.

If not, consider purchasing a policy designed for travellers, and covering short-term health and emergency assistance, as well as medical evacuation in the event of an accident or serious illness.
