Great! Fill me in.

#Passage Reading
Look in the mirror and accept responsibility.  
It's all about you. You are the only one who can turn things around or achieve the goals you set. Stop blaming and start doing, will you?  

Overcome rationalization  
Don't use logic to try and explain why you should stop achieving your goal or give up on your resolution. Logic can be found to support any argument on either side. There is as much logic that says you should keep going as there is telling you to stop. Don't rationalize and forget about logic, will you? Just keep going.  

Get over yourself  
I find that people who make excuses are afraid of what other people think of them. They think that every is scrutinizing them, take note of their failure and laughing at them behind their back.  So instead of putting themselves out there and possibly failing, they never try at all and just make excuses. Nobody is watching you and nobody cares if you fail. So quit your excuse-making. Everybody has too much going on in their own head to give much thought to you.  

Use that knowledge to allow yourself to take risks, allow yourself to fail and don't make excuses for it. You don't need to justify to someone else why you failed. All you need to do is pick yourself up and continue pursuing your goal. If you stop making excuses, you can actually focus on what you want to achieve, not why you haven't been achieving it.
