##Passage Reading
If you suffer from social anxiety disorder(SAD), you probably find it even more difficult to do so.

In order to effectively make requests of others, you first need to overcome thi obstacle.

The best way to confront your discomfort about making requests is to ask yourself a series of question about the logic of your feelings. This is known as logical refutation. Ask yourself:  
"What rights would I give someone else that I am not giving myself?"  
"Would an outsider agree with the logic of my thinking?"

Once you are in the right frame of mind to ask for what you need, it is important to make request using assertive communication.  

This passive communication style will leave you feeling frustrated and resentful.
