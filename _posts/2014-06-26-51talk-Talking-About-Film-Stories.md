##Teacher's suggestions

**GRAMMAR CORRECTIONS:**  
Some new words. Better: There are some new words that I don`t know. 

**Pronunciation：**  

No mispronunciations but you can practice these words:  
1. nostalgia = /nɒsˈtæl.dʒə/  
2. diaspora = /daɪˈæs.pər.ə/  
3. infatuated = /ɪnˈfæt.ju.eɪ.tɪd/

**Vocabulary and Expression**  

1. nostalgia = /nɒsˈtæl.dʒə/ a feeling of pleasure and also slight sadness when you think about things that happened in the past: Some people feel nostalgia for their schooldays. Hearing that tune again filled him with nostalgia. a wave (= sudden strong feeling) of nostalgia

2. diaspora = /daɪˈæs.pər.ə/ the spreading of people from one original country to other countries

3. infatuated = /ɪnˈfæt.ju.eɪ.tɪd/ having a very strong but not usually lasting feeling of love or attraction for someone or something: She was infatuated with her boss.

##Dialogue Reading

It tells the story of a time when undergraduates are infatuated with America and believe it's their only hope of a good future.  
The Grand Master  
Iron Man 3  
The Fast and Furious 6  
After Earth

##Passage Reading
Three buddies at Beijing's **prestigious** Yanjing U. are **simultaneously** prepping for American visa interviews.

He tell his friends he has no intention of returning to China.

With such a full agenda, the film never really coheres, yet its rags-to-riches does manage to entertain-that is, if you're China-inclined.

It's not like audiences worldwide haven;t suffered decades of Hollywood movies pushing overbearing pro-**American dogma**.
