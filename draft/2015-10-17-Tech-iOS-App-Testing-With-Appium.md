##What do I want to do
Currently, we test iOS app manually, it's OK for new features cause it will not take too much time. While when the features accumlate, it's harder and harder to perform regression test. At the same time, we are promoting BDD which means we need to build our test before the actual implementation. So it's necessary to do iOS test automatically.
