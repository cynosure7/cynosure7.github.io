I live in a small apartment on the fifth floor of a multi-storey apartment block. It's an average apartment, nothing too fancy. It's conveniently located, it has a cozy bedroom with a balcony, a light living room, a kitchenette and bath room. It's got large windows and a few piece of minimalist furniture. What I dislike about it is the number of bedrooms. It has only one bedroom, which is enough for me, but not when my parents or friends come.

My ideal house would be a detached house. It would have a spacious living room, a roomy kitchen and bathrooms, a couple of bedrooms and a garage[ɡə'rɑʒ]. Most importantly, it should have a big backyard for flowers and vegetables.  And hopefully, there would be a fish pond in the yard. It should have high ceilings, large rooms and a few modern furniture. Such a house would cost like 1 million dollars in cities like shanghai in china. So I guess it's nothing more than just a dream for me.
