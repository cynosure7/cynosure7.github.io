#Background
Java Reflection is an "advanced" feature ignored by many people, and I was one of them. In a Job interview, an interviewer asked "What's Java Reflection? How much do you know about it?". I stared at the person asking me this question and thought, I should know this! But at that moment, I couldn't quite remember, and then kicked myself mentally for not preparing for this. I did remember Java Reflection is an important feature, but I know little about it. I thought it was a complex feature and there was no demand to learn and use it in my project.

#What's Java Reflection
