#Background
Back to 2009 summer, Jiamin, Zhuofang and I spent our summer holiday on a project Dream-Bubble. This is a J2ME game, in that time, iphone and Android is becoming popular.
This project is valuable and memorable for it's the first real project for me, for our team.
##About TD-MAX
TD-MAX stands for "Three man, Dai, Min and Xiang". Min is the initiator, and he invites Dai and me to join his team. And our goal is to win a certain position in the competition.
