#Background
Johnny is my mentor, he is a senior engineer who has rich experience in Java Web Server Development. He wants to write a plug-in to simply tomcat hot deployment in develop. He talked about some works need to do, including a test script hit the store directly to measure the RW performance of our store.

#Suggestions
He recommend a book _Understanding the JVM Advanced Features and Best Practices_ to me. And asked me some questions:

How does Java work? For example, when you write a Hello World in Java and run it. What happens?

How does tomcat load class, what's sequence of the class load? If I write a Math class and put it in class folder in tomcat, will it work?

Do you know some new features from Java 1.4?

How much do you know about Java Multi-threads?

In recent work, we use Jesrsy, but do you know how it works?

Can you talk something about Java GC?

All in all, he suggest me to think deeply into the technology I'm using. It's far from enough for only fulfilling the task it self.
