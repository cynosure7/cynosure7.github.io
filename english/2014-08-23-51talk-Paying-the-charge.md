What form of money do you use most? Cash, check, debit card or credit card?  
When we buy items costing small amounts of money, we can pay in cash.  
But most of the time, we won't carry a lot of cash with us. Then we can pay in check, or by debit cards and credit cards.  
And there's concern over privacy and potential fraud, as more payment-related information goes digital.  
Having a good credit history is often important, not only when applying for credit cards, but also when applying for things such as loans, rental applications, or even some jobs.  
Some credit cards offer additional benefits, such as discount from particular stores or companies.
